Creating invoices and documents with a plaintext mindset.

# Motivation

After using my other tool [freelance](https://github.com/Tagirijus/freelance) for many years now for creating quotes and invoices for my clients, the motivation grew to make a better tool. Primary I like to work with plaintext files, which I can render or process with tools. Also I got bored of the cumberstone handling of _freelance_. Also some dependencies were off and after switching to a new system I even got problems using the tool at all.

So I decided to start a new project to get a tool with which I can create quotes and invoices. Hopefully after all the years I might have learned to code better so that the tool will be more useful and better to handle than my previous one.

During the development the project got an even better direction: the idea is now to not only be able to render invoices or quotes with it, but also every other kind of text document.

# Concept

The initial concept of the tool is (or was at least) to work with plaintext files. Or more in detail: it should be possible to edit the data without any third party tool and be still somehow be human readable. The tool itself in the end is for helping manage the data and also rendering it to a file I can send my clients (PDF probably). In addition it also should help append invoices to my accounting system, which uses [ledger-cli](https://ledger-cli.org/) _(at this point of development this is done via additional user scripts - I might publish my own scripts as well at some point)_.

I am writing this during development. So things might change and maybe I will forget to update this readme file in the end.

# Usage

**ATTENTION: do use this program at your own risk, since it's not finished yet!**

Start the program with the `-h` or `--help` option to get a proper list of possible commands and options.

TODO: as soon as the program gets a usable state, I hopefully will update the readme to better describe on how to use the program. Also some images would be nice, despite the fact that it's terminal based, yet still!

# To do

- Code the program!
